# Emergency-Response-Resources-Allocation
Resources allocation in hospital by using Bipartite graph matching and Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.
In emergency response scenarios, effective and timely allocation of resources is critical for minimizing the impact of crises and saving lives. This research proposes an optimization model for emergency response resource allocation based on bipartite graph matching techniques. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is employed to find maximum matching in the graph, allowing for the efficient pairing of resources to high-priority incidents based on criteria such as distance, availability, and urgency. The bipartite graph matching algorithm is applied to optimize the distribution of resources, considering constraints like resource availability, distance, and incident priority. The proposed model provides a scalable, efficient solution that enhances emergency response capabilities across varying incident types and operational constraints.
